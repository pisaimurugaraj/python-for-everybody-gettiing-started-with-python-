""" Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until
    the user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and
    smallest of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a valid number
    catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the
    number. Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output below."""
